    <h1>Garden Shed</h1>
    <p>
        The shed is built on slightly sloping ground, supported by pier foundations with ten posts set in concrete and topped with a 4m x 2m base. The base includes 18mm OSB screwed to joists running across the width of the bottom frame. The joists are filled with 50mm polystyrene sheet insulation.<br><br>
    
        The shed was designed around three second-hand UPVC windows and a used UPVC door, all of which were bought from Gumtree. The structural wood and cladding were sourced from Glasgow Wood.<br><br>
    
        After a few weekends cutting the structural timber to length from the drawings, it was assembled over a weekend. OSB sheets were used to clad the structure, and spaces for windows and doors were cut out with a reciprocating saw. 18mm OSB tongue-and-groove panels were used to form the roof, joined with quick-drying glue. DuPont housewrap waterproof material was stapled on, and battens were attached vertically and then horizontally, ready for the vertical cladding.<br><br>
    
        The windows and door were fitted, with gaps filled by expanding foam. Soffits and fascias were cut and fitted, and an EPDM rubber roof was installed along with trims. Finally, the vertical cladding was cut to size, screwed in place to finish the exterior, and stained with colored wood stain.
