    <h1>Pizza Oven</h1>
    <p>
        A frame was constructed to allow for a sloping roof, with a top compartment for the oven and a bottom space for kindling and logs. The base for the oven was made using 18mm OSB, supported by a central pillar located in the log store. On top of the OSB, I laid out empty glass wine bottles with their tops stuffed with cotton wool. These were covered with sand, and a layer of firebricks was set on top, forming the base of the pizza oven. The empty bottles and sand layer help the firebricks hold the heat. <br><br>
    
        The oven was built on top of this base using fireclay, sand, and straw mix, shaped over a sand mold. The frame was then clad with wood, leaving ventilation spaces, and double doors were fitted to the top and bottom compartments. An OSB roof, covered in felt, was then fitted, and finally, a steel chimney was added. <br><br>
    
        P.S. All cladding timber, including old scaffolding planks used to frame the oven base, was sourced from Glasgow Wood, a social enterprise.
